        <p>👋 Hi there Champ, let me make things easy. You will be doing here entering ✔️inputs and checking either the components are working fine or not, that is what we say <strong>Manual Testing 🐢</strong>, Sure go on.
        <br />
        But the main focus🎯 of this project is implemented <strong>Automatic Testing ⚡</strong>. Throughout all this project I was exploring🧭 the library. So, any from my tech guys if wanna see those testing practices of mine. See code💻 in the Github Repo using GitHub Code Button up in the navbar.</p>
        <p>Enjoy ☕</p>

        <Form />
      </main>
    </div>
